// An ordered sequence of numbers from 1 to N is given. One number might have deleted from it, then the remaining numbers were mixed. Find the number that was deleted.
// Example:

//     The starting array sequence is [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
//     The mixed array with one deleted number is [3,2,4,6,7,8,1,9]
//     Your function should return the int 5.

// If no number was deleted from the starting array, your function should return the int 0.

// Note: N may be 1 or less (in the latter case, the first array will be []).

function findDeletedNumber(arr, mixArr) {
    let arrSum = arr.reduce((a,b) => a + b, 0)
    let mixArrSum = mixArr.reduce((a,b) => a + b, 0)
    return arrSum - mixArrSum
