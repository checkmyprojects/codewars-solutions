// The goal of this Kata is to reduce the passed integer to a single digit (if not already) by converting the number to binary, taking the sum of the binary digits, and if that sum is not a single digit then repeat the process.

//     If the passed integer is already a single digit there is no need to reduce

//     n will be an integer such that 0 < n < 10⁹

function singleDigit(n) {
    while (n >= 10) {
        n = (n.toString(2).match(/1/g) || []).length;
    }
    return n;
